# What we did - A summary:
1 - A class named Payroll, that conforms to the IPrintable Protocol, stores the employees data in one dictionary, calculates the total of the payroll and exports the output to a Text file (payrollTotal.txt) and save it on Documents Directory of the User's Computer.

2 - A class named Utils contains the extensions to Date (.year) and to Double (.currency) to optimize the data print process.

3 - The class Exceptions was created with Error Handling purposes. The error is thrown in the initializers of the classes FullTime, PartTime, CommissionBasedPartTime, FixedBasedPartTime and Intern and catched on main.swift, where the respective error message is given to the user. 

4 - Also on main, one Test Case Object with an error was created  just for Error Handling purposes.
